# 1.4.9 - beta
---
- Updated crusaders list, added: Griz, Frankie, Graham, James, Saint Patrokia
- Fixed issues with how I added crusaders in 1.4.8 ((oops))
- Lots of internal changes in preperation for some refactoring and new features!
- Added developer (beta) options: 
-- screenshot tool. When option is set to 1 in lib/devFeatures.ini, the bot will attempt to take a screenshot just before resetting.
-- This captures the level / final dps / final gold bonus earned each run, to potentially help with formation planning.  
- ** Please report any issues you enounter. I've done heavy testing, but I'm sure I haven't touched everything. There is very
- ** little functional change in this release, mostly just moving code around, so it "should" be fine, but please report it 
- ** right away if it's not!
